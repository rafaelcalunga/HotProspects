#  HotProspects

This project is an app to track who you meet at conferences. 

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Read custom values from the environment with @EnvironmentObject
- Create tabs with TabView
- Share data across tabs using @EnvironmentObject
- Controll image interpolation in SwiftUI

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
